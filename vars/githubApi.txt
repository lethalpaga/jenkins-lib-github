Access the Github API. This is an unopiniated library that does not
do anything implicitly.

<h1> Authentication </h1>
The first step is to add your Github credentials. Make sure you fetch them
in a secure way (using withCredentials for example).

<code>
githubApi.setUser("myuser")
githubApi.setPassword("mypassword")
</code>

<h1> Github URL </h1>
Configure the github URL to point to the root of your github api.
For public Github that would be
<code>
githubApi.setUrl("https://api.github.com")
</code>

For Github Enterprise it usually looks like (depending on how it's set up):
<code>
githubApi.setUrl("https://<github url>/api/v3")
</code>

<h1> Send deployment statuses </h1>
<code>
def deployment_url = githubApi.createDeployment([
              ref: github.getGitCommit(),
              task: "deploy",
              environment: "test",
              transient_environment: true,
              required_contexts: []
            ])

github.createDeploymentStatus(deployment_url, 
            [
              state: "success",
              log_url: "https://mylog.mycompany.com",
              description: "Deployment successful!",
            ])
</code>
